# Bioimage Book ImageJ Plugins

This repo contains ImageJ plugins written to help develop https://bioimage-book.github.io

There are two of them:
* **Capture window screenshots**
  * This simplifies generating screenshots of individual windows, saving them result in a specified directory. It can also create a screenshot of multiple windows with a transparent background, and optionally use a timed delay (to help handle modal dialogs).
* **Show keypresses**
  * This visualizes keypresses in a way that can be useful for video recordings and demos.
